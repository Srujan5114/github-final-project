# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple interest calculator that computes interest given the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Purpose

This project is part of the Git and GitHub final project. It demonstrates basic version control usage and a simple interest calculation program.

## How it works

The calculator uses the simple interest formula:

Simple Interest = p * t * r

where:
- p is the principal amount
- t is the time period in years
- r is the annual rate of interest

## How to run

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/github-final-project.git
2. Change into the project directory:
   cd github-final-project
3. Run the program:

   # If it is a shell script
   bash simple-interest.sh

   # Or, if it is a Python script
   python simple_interest.py

## Example

For example:
- Principal (p) = 1000
- Time (t) = 2 years
- Rate (r) = 5

Simple Interest = 1000 * 2 * 5 = 10000
